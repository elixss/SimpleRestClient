# SimpleRestClient
A beginner project written in C# that allows you to perform GET requests to a REST API or something else

# Requirements
- PC that is connected to the internet
- .NET 6.0 or newer

# Usage
Download the program [here](https://github.com/elixss/SimpleRestClient/tree/master/Download 'Download here'). To download, click on "View Raw", or on the download button. Windows Defender might blow up when you execute it and maybe delete it.

# Perform Requests
Everything is pretty much straight foward. Currently, you can only do requests with GET. Formatted strings are coming later.
